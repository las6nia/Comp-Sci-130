		//Developing data structures, warehouses
						//Part 1 - linear data structures, part 2 - Tables, matrix, part 3 - Dynamic structures
		//Data structures, store data and retrieve data from lists and tables of value
		//Use methods to work with arrays  (warehouses), they have a requirement, same data type
		//Values, all int, or double, strings, char,  - you cannot have a mix of values in the warehouse (SAME DATA TYPE)
		
											//PART 1 - LINEAR DATA STRUCTURES
		//Question, How can we create an array in languages? 
		//Answer = 2 ways, 					you need the 
					//		Create an empty array = type [] array'sName = newType[size] = 
								//each array has the following = type, name, size.
						//The type of elements that will be stored in this array
					//size - the maximum number of elements that I can store in this array, known as length, capacity
		//........................................................................................................................
		//Task = create an array named AA that can store up to 10 integers
		int [] AA = new int [10];
	//Note - in each array is considered as a set or a line of spots or rooms where each room can store only a single element
	//We don't say value, we element
		//Each room has an index, you have 10 rooms, starting from 0 - 9 () 
//Task - create an array with 5 doubles called BB
		double [] BB = new double [5];
